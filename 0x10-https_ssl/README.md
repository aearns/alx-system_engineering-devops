File Name|Task Name|Task Description
---|---|---
[`0-https_abc`](https://github.com/jdrestre/holberton-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x10-https_ssl/0-https_abc)|0. HTTPS ABC|What is HTTPS? Why do you need HTTPS? You want to setup HTTPS on your website, where shall you place the certificate?
[`1-world_wide_web`](https://github.com/jdrestre/holberton-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x10-https_ssl/1-world_wide_web)|1. World wide web|Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain `www` points to your load-balancer IP (`lb-01`). Let’s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.
[`2-haproxy_ssl_termination`](https://github.com/jdrestre/holberton-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x10-https_ssl/2-haproxy_ssl_termination)|2. HAproxy SSL termination|Create a certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www.
[`100-redirect_http_to_https`](https://github.com/jdrestre/holberton-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x10-https_ssl/100-redirect_http_to_https)|3. No loophole in your website traffic|A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
